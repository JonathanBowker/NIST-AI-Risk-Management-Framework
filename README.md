# NIST-AI Risk Management Playbook

## Workplace
The Playbook provides suggested actions for achieving the outcomes laid out in the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Core (Tables 1 – 4 in AI RMF 1.0). Suggestions are aligned to each sub-category within the four AI RMF functions (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage).

The Playbook is neither a checklist nor set of steps to be followed in its entirety.

Playbook suggestions are voluntary. Organizations may utilize this information by borrowing as many – or as few – suggestions as apply to their industry use case or interests.
