Some legal requirements can mandate (e.g., nondiscrimination, data privacy and security controls) documentation, disclosure, and increased AI system transparency. These requirements are complex and may not be applicable or differ across applications and contexts. \n \nFor example, AI system testing processes for bias measurement, such as disparate impact, are not applied uniformly within the legal context. Disparate impact is broadly defined as a facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately harms a group based on a protected trait. Notably, some modeling algorithms or debiasing techniques that rely on demographic information, could also come into tension with legal prohibitions on disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination).\n\nAdditionally, some intended users of AI systems may not have consistent or reliable access to fundamental internet technologies (a phenomenon widely described as the \u201cdigital divide\u201d) or may experience difficulties interacting with AI systems due to disabilities or impairments. Such factors may mean different communities experience bias or other negative impacts when trying to access AI systems.

Risk tolerance rating policies consider different sources of risk, (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, or model risks). A typical risk measurement approach entails the multiplication, or qualitative combination, of measured or estimated impact and likelihood of impacts into a risk score (risk \u2248 impact x likelihood). This score is then placed on a risk scale. Scales for risk may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches.

When coupled with the enhanced organizational culture resulting from the established policies and procedures in the Govern function, the Map function can provide opportunities to foster and instill new perspectives, activities, and skills for approaching risks and impacts. \n\nContext mapping also includes discussion and consideration of non-AI or  non-technology alternatives especially as related to whether the given context is narrow enough to manage AI and its potential negative impacts.

The interdependencies between these activities, and among the relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms. These risks and incidents can result from a variety of factors. For example, downstream decisions can be influenced by end user over-trust or under-trust, and other complexities related to AI-supported decision-making.\n\nAnticipating, articulating, assessing and documenting AI systems\u2019 knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans can help mitigate the uncertainty associated with the realities of AI system deployments.

        "section_about":"Standard testing and evaluation protocols provide a basis to confirm assurance in a system that it is operating as designed and claimed. AI systems\u2019 complexities create challenges for traditional testing and evaluation methodologies, which tend to be designed for static or isolated system performance.  Opportunities for risk continue well beyond design and deployment, into system operation and application of system-enabled decisions. Testing and evaluation methodologies and metrics therefore address a continuum of activities. TEVV is enhanced when key metrics for performance, safety, and reliability are interpreted in a socio-technical context and not confined to the boundaries of the AI system pipeline. \n\nOther challenges for managing AI risks relate to dependence on large scale datasets, which can impact data quality and validity concerns. The difficulty of finding the \u201cright\u201d data may lead AI actors to select datasets based more on accessibility and availability than on suitability for operationalizing the phenomenon that the AI system intends to support or inform. Such decisions could contribute to an environment where the data used in processes is not fully representative of the populations or phenomena that are being modeled, introducing downstream risks.  Practices such as dataset reuse may also lead to disconnect from the social contexts and time periods of their creation.  This contributes to issues of validity of the underlying dataset for providing proxies, measures, or predictors within the model.",

AI systems can autonomously make decisions, defer decision-making to a human expert, or be used by a human decision-maker as an additional opinion.

Depending on the purpose of the system, the expert may interact with the AI system but is rarely part of the design or development of the system itself. These experts are not necessarily familiar with machine learning, data science, computer science, or other fields traditionally associated with AI design or development and - depending on the application - will likely not require such familiarity. For example, for AI systems that are deployed in health care delivery the experts are the physicians and bring their expertise about medicine\u2014not data science, data modeling and engineering, or other computational factors. The challenge in these settings is not educating the end user about AI system capabilities, but rather leveraging, and not replacing, practitioner domain expertise.\n\nQuestions remain about how to configure humans and automation for managing AI risks. Risk management is enhanced when organizations that design, develop or deploy AI systems for use by professional operators and practitioners:\n\n-  are aware of these knowledge limitations and strive to identify risks in human-AI interactions and configurations across all contexts, and the potential resulting impacts, \n- define and differentiate the various human roles and responsibilities when using or interacting with AI systems, and\n- determine proficiency standards for AI system operation in proposed context of use, as enumerated in MAP-1 and established in GOVERN-3.2.",

Transparency is a central element of effective AI risk management that enables insight into how an AI system is working, and the ability to address risks if and when they emerge. The ability for system users, individuals, or impacted communities to seek redress for incorrect or problematic AI system outcomes is one control for transparency and accountability. Higher level recourse processes are typically enabled by lower level implementation efforts directed at explainability and interpretability functionality. See Measure 2.9.\n\nTransparency and accountability across organizations and processes is crucial to reducing AI risks. Accountable leadership \u2013 whether individuals or groups \u2013 and transparent roles, responsibilities, and lines of communication foster and incentivize quality assurance and risk management activities within organizations.\n\nLack of transparency complicates measurement of trustworthiness and whether AI systems or organizations are subject to effects of various individual and group biases and design blindspots and could lead to diminished user, organizational and community trust, and decreased overall system value.

        "section_about":"Fairness in AI includes concerns for equality and equity by addressing issues such as harmful bias and discrimination. Standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application. Organizations\u2019 risk management efforts will be enhanced by recognizing and considering these differences. Systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair. For example, systems in which predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital divide or may exacerbate existing disparities or systemic biases.\n\nBias is broader than demographic balance and data representativeness. NIST has identified three major categories of AI bias to be considered and managed: systemic, computational and statistical, and human-cognitive. Each of these can occur in the absence of prejudice, partiality, or discriminatory intent. \n\n- Systemic bias can be present in AI datasets, the organizational norms, practices, and processes across the AI lifecycle, and the broader society that uses AI systems.\n- Computational and statistical biases can be present in AI datasets and algorithmic processes, and often stem from systematic errors due to non-representative samples.\n- Human-cognitive biases relate to how an individual or group perceives AI system information to make a decision or fill in missing information, or how humans think about purposes and functions of an AI system. Human-cognitive biases are omnipresent in decision-making processes across the AI lifecycle and system use, including the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of AI.\n\nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives. While bias is not always a negative phenomenon, AI systems can potentially increase the speed and scale of biases and perpetuate and amplify harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society.",
        "section_actions":"- Conduct fairness assessments to manage computational and statistical forms of bias which include the following steps:\n    - Identify types of harms, including allocational, representational, quality of service, stereotyping, or erasure\n    - Identify across, within, and intersecting groups that might be harmed\n    - Quantify harms using both a general fairness metric, if appropriate (e.g. demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity, statistical hypothesis tests), and custom, context-specific metrics developed in collaboration with affected communities\n    - Analyze quantified harms for contextually significant differences across groups, within groups, and among intersecting groups \n    - Refine identification of within-group and intersectional group disparities. \n        - Evaluate underlying data distributions and employ sensitivity analysis during the analysis of quantified harms. \n        - Evaluate quality  metrics including false positive rates and false negative rates. \n        - Consider biases affecting small groups, within-group or intersectional communities, or single individuals.\n- Understand and consider sources of bias in training and TEVV data:\n    - Differences in distributions of outcomes across and within groups, including intersecting groups. \n    - Completeness, representativeness and balance of data sources. \n    - Identify input data features that may serve as proxies for demographic group membership (i.e., credit score, ZIP code) or otherwise give rise to emergent bias within AI systems.   \n    - Forms of systemic bias in images, text (or word embeddings), audio or other complex or unstructured data.  \n- Leverage impact assessments to identify and classify system impacts and harms to end users, other individuals, and groups with input from potentially impacted communities.\n- Identify the classes of individuals, groups, or environmental ecosystems which might be impacted through direct engagement with potentially impacted communities. \n- Evaluate systems in regards to disability inclusion, including consideration of disability status in bias testing, and discriminatory screen out processes that may arise from non-inclusive design or deployment decisions. \n- Develop objective functions in consideration of systemic biases, in-group\/out-group dynamics.\n- Use context-specific fairness metrics to examine how system performance varies across  groups, within groups, and\/or for intersecting groups. Metrics may include statistical parity, error-rate equality, statistical parity difference, equal opportunity difference, average absolute odds difference, standardized mean difference, percentage point differences.\n- Customize fairness metrics to specific context of use to examine how system performance and potential harms vary within contextual norms. \n- Define acceptable levels of difference in performance in accordance with established organizational governance policies, business requirements, regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, and ethical standards within the context of use\n- Define the actions to be taken if disparity levels rise above acceptable levels. \n- Identify groups within the expected population that may require disaggregated analysis, in collaboration with impacted communities. \n- Leverage experts with knowledge in the specific context of use to investigate substantial measurement differences and identify root causes for those differences.\n- Monitor system outputs for performance or bias issues that exceed established tolerance levels.  \n- Ensure periodic model updates; test and recalibrate with updated and more representative data to stay within acceptable levels of difference.\n- Apply pre-processing data transformations to address factors related to demographic balance and data representativeness.\n- Apply in-processing to balance model performance quality with bias considerations. \n- Apply post-processing mathematical\/computational techniques to model results in close collaboration with impact assessors, socio-technical experts, and other AI actors with expertise in the context of use. \n- Apply model selection approaches with transparent and deliberate consideration of bias management and other trustworthy characteristics. \n- Collect and share information about differences in outcomes for the identified groups. \n- Consider mediations to mitigate differences, especially those that can be traced to past patterns of unfair or biased human decision making.\n- Utilize human-centered design practices to generate deeper focus on societal impacts and counter human-cognitive biases within the AI lifecycle.\n- Evaluate practices along the lifecycle to identify potential sources of human-cognitive bias such as availability, observational, and confirmation bias, and to make implicit decision making processes more explicit and open to investigation. \n- Work with human factors experts to evaluate biases in the presentation of system output to end users, operators and practitioners.\n- Utilize processes to enhance contextual awareness, such as diverse internal staff and stakeholder engagement.",

When combined with results from Measure 2.5 to 2.11 and Measure 4.1 and 4.2, TEVV actors can maintain a comprehensive view of system performance. These measures can be augmented through participatory engagement with potentially impacted communities or other forms of stakeholder elicitation about AI systems\u2019 impacts. These sources of information can allow AI actors to explore potential adjustments to system components, adapt operating conditions, or institute performance improvements.",
